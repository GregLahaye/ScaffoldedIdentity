# ScaffoldedIdentity
.NET 5 Web Application with all Identity pages scaffolded to act as a reference 

## Purpose
This repository acts as a reference for those who wish to view how the built-in Identity pages are structured, as their source cannot be viewed without manually scaffolding them.

For example, if you are creating a page that registers new users you may find viewing the [Register.cshtml](https://github.com/GregLahaye/ScaffoldedIdentity/blob/master/ScaffoldedIdentity/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cshtml) and [Register.cs](https://github.com/GregLahaye/ScaffoldedIdentity/blob/master/ScaffoldedIdentity/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Register.cs) helpful.

The scaffolded pages are stored in the [/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account](https://github.com/GregLahaye/ScaffoldedIdentity/tree/master/ScaffoldedIdentity/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account) folder

## More Information
This repository was created by generating a new ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET 5) with Indiviual Accounts.

Identity pages were then scaffolded through: Add > New Scaffolded Item > Identity > Override all files
